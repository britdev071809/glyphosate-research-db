summary: |
  This review paper hypothesizes that glyphosate, via inhibition of the shikimate pathway in gut bacteria, suppresses cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and disrupts amino acid biosynthesis. The authors propose that these alterations may contribute to modern diseases such as obesity, depression, and inflammatory bowel disease. The paper synthesizes existing evidence linking glyphosate exposure to dysbiosis and metabolic disturbances.

## Detailed Summary

This theoretical review, published in *Entropy* in 2013, examines the potential systemic health effects of glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide Roundup. The authors argue that glyphosate’s known mechanism of action—inhibition of the enzyme 5‑enolpyruvylshikimate‑3‑phosphate synthase (EPSPS) in the shikimate pathway—could affect beneficial gut bacteria that possess this pathway. By disrupting bacterial synthesis of essential aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan), glyphosate may indirectly impair host cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity, which relies on these amino acids for proper function.

The paper further suggests that glyphosate‑induced suppression of CYP enzymes could reduce the liver’s ability to detoxify xenobiotics, while the disruption of amino acid homeostasis might influence serotonin and dopamine production, potentially linking glyphosate exposure to neurological and metabolic disorders. Although the article is a hypothesis‑driven review rather than an original experimental study, it has been widely cited in discussions about glyphosate’s possible role in the rise of chronic “modern” diseases.

## Key Points

- Glyphosate may inhibit the shikimate pathway in commensal gut bacteria, leading to reduced synthesis of aromatic amino acids.
- Aromatic amino acids are precursors for mammalian cytochrome P450 enzymes; their depletion could impair detoxification capacity.
- The authors propose a cascade linking glyphosate exposure to gut dysbiosis, decreased CYP activity, and increased susceptibility to obesity, depression, autism, inflammatory bowel disease, and other conditions.
- The hypothesis is supported by correlative epidemiological data and known biochemical pathways, but direct experimental evidence in humans is limited.

## Study Type

- **Type:** Review article (theoretical/hypothesis)
- **Model System:** In‑silico and literature‑based analysis
- **Exposure Assessment:** Not applicable (review of existing evidence)

## Limitations

- No original data presented; the paper is a synthesis of existing knowledge.
- The proposed mechanisms remain speculative and have not been conclusively validated by subsequent experimental studies.
- Relies heavily on correlation rather than causation.
