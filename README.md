# Glyphosate Research Knowledge Base

A structured, community-vetted knowledge base cataloging scientific studies on glyphosate's impact on the gut microbiome and its potential link to food sensitivities.

## Purpose

This repository aims to provide a reliable, search-friendly resource for scientists, health advocates, and interested individuals. By formalizing the process of adding, reviewing, and integrating research findings, we ensure that the collected information is accurate, up-to-date, and easily accessible.

## Structure

All accepted studies are listed as individual Markdown files within the [`entries/`](entries/) directory. Each entry follows a consistent YAML frontmatter template that includes:

- **Title**, authors, journal, year, and DOI
- A neutral summary of methods and findings
- Relevant tags (e.g., `gut-microbiome`, `shikimate-pathway`, `food-sensitivity`)

## How to Use

1. **Browse entries** – Navigate to the [`entries/`](entries/) folder to see all studies.
2. **Search by tag** – Use GitHub's file search or clone the repository and filter by tags.
3. **Contribute** – Please read [`entries/CONTRIBUTING.md`](entries/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on proposing and adding new studies.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that follow a rigorous, peer‑review‑inspired workflow:

1. Open an issue with the label `new‑submission` to propose a study.
2. Create a branch, write the entry according to the template, and open a pull request.
3. The PR will be reviewed for formatting, accuracy, and appropriate tagging before being merged.

See [`entries/CONTRIBUTING.md`](entries/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions.
